      <div class="ui header" id="header1">Our Mission</div>
      <p>At <i>The Omni Project</i>, we’re helping build the next generation of scholarly communications. The academic publishing system is deeply broken — the dissemination of research has become tightly intertwined with the commercial interests of publishers and the growing importance of reputation in academia.</p>
      <p>We want to help break this industry deadlock, by disentangling research output from profit and prestige. The best way to achieve this is by giving academics the tools to collectively build an alternative model from the ground-up, which can allow a fundamentally better and more sustainable system to emerge.</p>
      <p>Our vision for <i>The Omni Project</i> is to start bringing the world's academics closer together, leveraging the collective intelligence of academic communities, and scaling academic discussion to an unprecedented level. Afterall, this is what the Internet was originally intended for, and only then can academia re-align with its original purpose — to share new knowledge with the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ui text container">
      <div class="ui header" id="header2">Omni Platform</div>
      <p>After a year of extensive research, our team is currently building Omni — a platform for writing, sharing, discussing and reviewing research papers with academic communities. We're not creating another journal or publisher either. Omni is a public, digital space for academics to share their work without barriers, quickly reach their intended audiences and receive feedback from anyone in the academic community.</p>
      <p>We're essentially building a "scholary commons" for more accessible, open and participatory research. In fact, the entire research process can be streamlined on Omni (from conception to dissemination) which can drastically improve the flow of information and ideas:</p>
      <div class="ui bulleted list">
        <div class="item">Write articles using an advanced online editor, or upload your own</div>
        <div class="item">Share articles with communities, get feedback and start discussions</div>
        <div class="item">Discover the best, most recent and controversial papers in your field</div>
        <div class="item">Review papers and help the community decide what valid research looks like</div>
        <div class="item">Get rewarded for all your contributions, and build a more meaningful reputation</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="ui text container">
      <div class="ui medium header" id="header3">Powerful Features</div>
      <div class="ui small header">Contextual information</div>
      <p>Create your own reading experience by customising the left and right sidebars next to a paper. Choose whether to show the contents, comments, figures, appendices or references, or hide both sidebards for a clean experience. And each item in a contextual sidebar appears directly next to the part of the paper it's related to.</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Manage Dynamic Papers</div>
      <p>No paper is ever complete or final. Authors can write their papers within Omni, receive feedback from the community and easily make changes. Every edit is documented, archived and made transparent. Invite co-authors to collaborate, and even choose to keep your work offline until its ready to share.</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Get feedback from day one</div>
      <p>All papers on Omni are open to feedback from anyone in the academic community. Rather than writing a full peer-review, users can create discussion threads at various points in the paper. Readers can upvote/downvote comments, and also suggest edits or flag issues to the author (and if approved, are credited as contributors to the paper).</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Engage with your communities</div>
      <p>Communities can form around any field or topic in academia, where research papers are assessed and reviewed according to their own measures of quality, validity and significance. Academics can follow the most recent, popular and controversial papers in a field, and discuss them with other like-minded people.</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Reputation that makes sense</div>
      <p>You won't find an impact factor or h-index on Omni. Instead, an academic's reputation is determined by a vast range of factors — including how well they engage with communities and the quality of their contributions. In other words, the more you contribute to academic research, the better your reputation becomes.</p>

      <div class="ui medium header" id="header4">Why Holochain?</div>
      <p>The Omni application will be hosted on a distributed network of computers, rather than centralised servers. It'll use a fully distributed, peer-to-peer protocol called <a href="https://www.holochain.org">Holochain</a> — a truly decentralised, democratic, secure Internet, with the capacity for large-scale social coordination. In other words, the academic community can essentially become a fully autonomous organisation, without the need for a middleman or top-down incentive structure.</p>
      <p>We're building Omni on a system of value creation, credit, transparency, accountability and community engagement (principles that academia <i>should</i> be built on). The technology that Omni is using can allow the following:</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Own your work</div>
      <p>Holochain ensures that all users and data on Omni have digital signatures, meaning true authorship can always be verified. Authors are also protected under a Creative Commons license, and no longer have to relinquish their ownership rights to publishing companies.</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Open-source</div>
      <p>We're building Omni as an open-source application. We're inviting the community to help contribute to its development on Github, and any proposed changes to the application will be resolved democratically.</p>
      <div class="ui small header">Free to use, forever</div>
      <p>We strongly believe in making knowledge and research as accessible as possible. Therefore, we're planning for the Omni platform to be completely free. In order to fund the project, we'll be relying on altruistic support and funding.</p>
